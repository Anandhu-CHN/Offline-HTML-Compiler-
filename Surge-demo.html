<p class="text-center sm:text-justify bg-white text-sky-800 font-sans text-xl py-3 px-2 mx-1 my-4  rounded-sm sm: rounded-md"> 

Surge is a forum associated with the Electrical Department of College of Engineering Chengannur registered under Travancore-Cochin ACT, aimed at uplifting the students technically in every way. Surge incorporates its members with all the new innovative technologies, promote and implement their ideas and for bringing out the best in the electrical engineering field. As a part of its technical activities, many sessions such as workshops, seminar, orientation class, etc were held to nurture the budding engineers. Kerala recently faced its worst flooding in nearly a century and Chengannur was one of the most affected areas with a large number of refugees. In collaboration with KSEB, the monumental task of restoring basic lighting and power supply to all homes was completed by the project named “Mission Reconnect” in which Surge members got an opportunity to become part of the state-wide rehabilitation. Surge provides a perfect platform for those who inclined to achieve a deeper understanding of engineering processes and to become a good quality Engineer.
